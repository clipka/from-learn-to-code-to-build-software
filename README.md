# from-learn-to-code-to-build-software

You walked through a programming tutorial and learned a bit of coding. Now you have a bold idea. You open your code editor and ... don't know how to start.
Too many things come to your mind. You need user management, login, a database and a hundred things more. You are already quite lost and you start with many things in parallel. After a while you get frustrated because you make no progress and your code becomes messy before anything works at all.

Take a step back. Think about the core idea of what you want to achieve and focus on that and build a prototype first. This guide will help you to move from learning to code to building software.

This guide will not take the usual blog post or user login as example. We will look at a more sofistcated product.
