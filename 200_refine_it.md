## Refine it!

### Refinement of user stories - Round 1

If you read literature on agile methology, you will sooner or later stumble over terms like _epics_ and _refinement_. Generally spoken, an _epic_ is just a big user story that needs refinement before it can be implemented.

Let's have a closer look at the user story `As Emma, I want to search for available jobs so that I can apply for them.` Looks like, we created an epic instead of a specific user story.

If you want to implement this epic, you will have a lot of questions. How exactly shall the search work. What search criteria can be applied to narrow down the list of job offerings.

The task to find answers to that question and define more detailed user stories is the _refinement_. There are a lot of strategies to refine epics or big user stories.

But sometimes it is better to take a break and look at the problem from another angle. Instead of directly refining the initial idea, we can try to come up with a different story that is easier to implement in the first place.

`Emma` could, instead of searching for jobs, just view a list of all available job offerings. That is much easier to implement. For a proof-of-concept implementation, that will work as well since we don't have a running service with hopefully thousands of users, but just a list of example offerings. So a search function is some basic functionality like user management that we can introduce later.

So let's create another user story to describe that functionality.

`As Emma, I want to view a list of all available job offerings.`

Of course, the search feature will not disappear but it is really not the first thing we actually need for a proof of concept.
